<h1>Inner structure of HTML</h1>
<h2>Brief introduction to rendering</h2>
<p>
  Classical programs render their content by giving direct commands
  of what, where (on screen), and how (sequence of commands) to draw.
  For example:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Draw rectangle (0, 0) with size (80, 80)</li>
  <li>Draw text "Hello," at (10, 30)</li>
  <li>Draw text "world!" at (10, 50)</li>
</ol>
<p>which produces result like this:</p>
<svg width="82" height="82">
  <rect x="1" y="1" width="80" height="80" style="fill:white;stroke:black;"></rect>
  <text x="10" y="30">Hello,</text>
  <text x="10" y="50">world!</text>
</svg>
<p>
  This gives a fine-grained control,
  but at the cost of extreme verbosity of the displaying process.
  HTML just tells "draw this somehow, I only want these conditions to be satisfied".
  The "conditions" are written in the short declarative form of Cascade Style Sheets.
