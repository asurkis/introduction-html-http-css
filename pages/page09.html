<h1>HTTP</h1>
<p>
  So, we've got the format in which the documents are <strong>presented</strong>.
  But what about <strong>transfering</strong>?
  For that the HyperText Transfer Protocol exists.
  It works like this:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The client establishes connection with the server</li>
  <li>
    The client sends a <strong>request</strong> —
    a description of the resource that the client wants,
    for example, <code>/index.php</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    The server processes the <strong>request</strong>
    and forms the <strong>response</strong>.
    On this step the server figures out
    which exactly document the client wants,
    whether or not it is possible to provide it,
    and forms the text of the document to send back.
    The document can be in HTML,
    or any other text format such as CSS, JS, JSON, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    The server sends the <strong>response</strong> —
    either the resource requested,
    or a description of an error.
    HTTP has error codes that allow
    the client to quickly analyze
    whether the response is OK,
    should be sent elsewhere,
    there is an error on the client side,
    or an error on the server side.
  </li>
  <li>
    The client processes the response (and the error code).
    The response can contain <strong>absolutely any</strong> text,
    usually with a hint about its format.
    If the client is a browser and the response is in HTML,
    then the browser sends other requests to download
    the style sheets and scripts,
    and then starts displaying the document.
  </li>
  <li>Either the client or the server stop the connection.</li>
</ol>
