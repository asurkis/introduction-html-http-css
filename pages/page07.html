  A text format seems useful,
  because it is human editable — you can pick any text editor, and just edit the file.

  Turns out, that angular brackets — &lt; and &gt;
  — are used rarely in the actual texts,
  so in HTML they are used to mark the "tags".
  A tag is an element of the document hierarchy,
  like table cell, table row, table, etc.
  So a "table data cell" looks like this:
  <code>&lt;td&gt;Some text&lt;/td&gt;</code>
</p>

<p>
  When we need to insert a "less than" or "greater than"
  into the page we can use
  <code>&amp;lt;</code> or <code>&amp;gt;</code>,
  and when we need an ampersand, then we use
  <code>&amp;amp;</code>
</p>

<p id="attributes">
  In addition, it is useful to give "attributes" to tags,
  such as the reference for the hyperlink,
  or the unique identifier by which an element can be referenced.
  With attributes the element starts looking like this:
  <code>&lt;p id="attributes"&gt;(some text about attributes)&lt;/p&gt;</code>
</p>
