<h1 id="example">Example HTML document</h1>
<h2>What HTML was initially meant to solve</h2>
<p>
  Initially HyperText Markup Language was meant for writing
  documents that don't necessarily have to be printed but rather can
  be displayed on screen.
</p>

<p>
  For documents it is useful to split text into paragraphs,
  as well as have some ways to <strong>emphasize</strong>
  some <em>particular</em> elements.
