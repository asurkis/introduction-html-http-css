<p>
  Often scientific documents reference each other,
  and for such references the mechanism of links,
  or "anchors", is used.
  We can make a clickable link to either
  <a href="index.php">a different document</a>,
  or
  <a href="#attributes">specific part of this document</a>.
  We can reference
  <a href="https://example.com">a different domain entirely</a>,
  but more on that later.

  Sometimes images are also required in the documents.
