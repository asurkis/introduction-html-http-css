<h1>How HTML works</h1>
<p>
  Surely, we can see that HTML fits for writing documents,
  and somehow is used to exchange them. But how exactly does it work?
</p>

<p>
  First of all, the developers have noticed that the overall structure
  of the documents looks like a hierarchy:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>List items are parts of the list</li>
  <li>The list is a part of the paragraph</li>
  <li>The paragraph is a part of the document</li>
  <li>And so on</li>
</ol>
