<h2>Why is CSS important?</h2>
<p>
  It historically happened that a lot of information
  is available in the form of websites.
  If these were printed documents,
  then we would have to parse them using computer vision.
  But in fact most of the information on the Internet
  is already provided to us in a nice structured form.
  CSS is used for styles,
  but we can also "exploit" it for finding the elements on the page
  that are of any particular interest for us.
</p>
<p>
  Just like the selector from the previous chapter allows us to
  <span class="true">adjust the visuals</span>,
  it also allows us to find the elements it's applied to.
</p>
<p>
  Keeping that in mind, we can parse web pages easily.
